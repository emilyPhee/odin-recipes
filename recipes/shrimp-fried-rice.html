    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Ever since we lost our good friend Mr.Cuckoo (the name brand of our rice
      cooker) a few months ago, we never have any leftover rice (which is ideal
      for fried rice) because our new one makes exactly four servings. And since
      my futile attempts at fixing Mr.Cuckoo had reached its end, the missus had
      to make new rice and let it cool for a few hours. Enjoy this fried rice
      with kimchi and other Korean side dishes.

      <li>2 cups shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
      <li>½ onion, diced</li>
      <li>½ (15.25 ounce) can whole kernel corn, drained</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>2 eggs, beaten (Optional)</li>
      <li>4 cups cooked rice, cooled - or more to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce, or more to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>

      <li>4 eggs, divided (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and
        cook and stir carrot and green bell pepper until slightly softened,
        about 5 minutes; stir shrimp, onion, corn, and garlic into carrot
        mixture. Cook and stir until shrimp turn pink and are no longer
        translucent, 5 more minutes. Pour off any liquid. Turn heat to low and
        let mixture simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate skillet over medium heat; pour
        2 beaten eggs into hot oil and scramble the eggs until firm and no
        longer runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix scrambled eggs lightly into shrimp and
        vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir rice, oyster sauce, soy sauce, 1 tablespoon butter, and salt into
        shrimp mixture, tossing until rice is thoroughly combined with shrimp
        and vegetables and coated with sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 teaspoon butter in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat
        until butter stops foaming; break 1 of the 4 remaining eggs into the hot
        butter. Cover skillet and let egg cook until the bottom is slightly
        browned, the yolk is runny, and the top of the white is slightly firm,
        about 3 minutes. Set egg aside. Repeat with remaining 3 eggs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve shrimp fried rice topped with fried eggs. For a nice presentation,
        fill a bowl with 1/4 of the fried rice, press lightly to compact, and
        turn fried rice out onto a serving plate in a dome shape; top with a
        fried egg. Repeat with remaining rice and eggs.
      </li>
    </ol>
